17:00 In the canteen¬¬Jon: Hey Conan have you been waiting for a long time?¬Conan: Not really, just 30 minutes. I spend some time playing this game.
Jon: Good. Have you seen Yousif and Elly?¬Conan: No¬Jon: They will probably be late as always.¬Conan: yeah maybe.
Jon: We can wait for 30 minutes and if they don’t come, we will just start without them.¬Conan: Yeah, that sounds good.
Conan (Thinking):Its weird that Elly agreed to date Yousif, first he is a douche, and no woman should be stuck with him secondly he was almost responsible for her brother’s death. Uh. People do strange things.
